# Isomeric trees and the order of Runge--Kutta methods (by Butcher, Podhaisky, Arxiv 2021)

Isomers.m computes with Mathematica in about 5 seconds the isomeric classes up to order p=12.

## Results

- The isomers for order 5 are Tree 12 ~ Tree 15, in raw output:  {{12,15}}
- for p = 6: {{21,30},{25,31},{26,32,35},{28,33}}
- for p = 7: {{41,67},{44,50},{45,68},{46,69,78},{48,70},{52,55,72},{53,60},{54,71},{56,73,79},{57,74,80,83},{61,64,75},{62,65,76,81}}
- for p = 8: {{89,154},{92,115},{93,155},{94,156,182},{96,157},{99,116},{100,103,117,126,159,165},{101,137},{102,158},{104,160,183},{105,161,184,193},{108,118},{109,112,162},{110,113,163,185},{121,127,166},{122,128,131,167,170,187},{123,138,147},{124,129,139,142,148,168,175},{125,164},{130,169,186},{132,171,188,194},{133,172,189,195,198},{135,173},{141,146,174},{143,150,151,176,179,190},{144,152,177,180,191,196},{149,178}}
